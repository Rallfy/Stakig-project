Hello, here are all the necessary links:

During the process of deploying and verifying the smart contracts, I encountered an issue with verifying the contracts on Etherscan due to API errors. 
Although Etherscan verification was not successful due to API limitations, I utilized **Sourcify** to ensure the transparency and correctness of the deployed contracts.
